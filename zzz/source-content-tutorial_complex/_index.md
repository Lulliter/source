<!-- This feature can be used for publishing content such as:

* **Project or software documentation**
* **Online courses**
* **Tutorials**

The parent folder may be renamed, for example, to `docs` for project documentation or `course` for creating an online course.

To disable this feature, either delete the parent folder, or set `draft = true` in the front matter of all its pages. 

After renaming or deleting the parent folder, you may wish to update any `[[menu.main]]` menu links to it in the `config.toml`.  -->

I will use this section of the blog to store some "tutorials" that recap some things I learned in R. 
Basically, these are useful pieces of my routine analytical workflow that I need to recap in such a way that I can easily repeat.
