<h2>Analysis of Fundraising data for Non Profit “NYE Encounter”</h2>
<p>Since March 2018, I have worked part-time as a Pro-Bono Fundraising Data Analyst for the nonprofit organization <a href="http://www.newyorkencounter.org/">New York Encounter</a>. I performed several ETL tasks –via SQL-based data transformations and R programming– to set up the integration of data that existed in separate and disconnected platforms. Namely, the Nonprofit had informations on donors and attendees on <strong>SendGrid</strong>, donations recorded via <strong>Square</strong> and miscellaneous other information in <strong>Salesforce</strong>. After cleaning and merging such information, I performed an initial explorative characterization of the Nonprofit private donors. Most of the data integration and analisys was performed in R.</p>
