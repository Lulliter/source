## Study of World Bank's WDI indicator **_Life expectancy at birth_**

This mini-study project was an exercise to learn how to use the World Bank's API for the [World Development Indicator (WDI)](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/) repository. 

In this study, I explore the indicator **_Life expectancy at birth_** and I also do some comparative analisys using other indicators that I expect to be highly correlated with life expectancy: namely **GDP** and the status of **Fragile and conflict affected situations** (FCS). 

> In order to flag the individual countries that are classified as FCS, I used the World Bank list of economies (as of June 2017) found [here](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/CLASS.xls)
