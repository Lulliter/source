### About this blog
This blog is intended as a place to collect notes-to-self, R code snippets, inspiring ideas, and side-projects that stay tenaciously planted on my "To-Do" list. 

Its content is tangentially related to my 'official' job (see links to other platforms or CV for that) and inspired by the wonderful community of R users -- especially many cool strangers :sparkles: who generously share they knowledge and projects (I :heart:[#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats))

### About me
Born and raised in :it:, I have been in the :us: for 10+ years, based in Washington, DC. When I am not procrastinating, or chasing a decent espresso, I am a consultant for multi-lateral development banks, passionate about using data to understand and tackle various dimensions of infrastructure poverty.
